## **Plugin Usage**

The OpenWithMenu plugin adds a new item to the right-click menu and a sub-menu to the Prism2 User Settings menu.  This plugin allows users to open various files (in the Scenefiles, Media and Library tabs) using a program of choice.  Prism2's default action when double-clicking a media item is to open in the selected viewer, or the system's default.

**Example usage:**  user needs to open a .png with Photoshop to edit, but then open with fSpy for the alignment.

The menu of OpenWithMenu allows users to select applications to be displayed in the right-click menu.  The user selects the location of the application executable, and a short-name that will be displayed in the right-click menu.





## **Installation**

This plugin is for Windows only, as Prism2 only supports Windows at this time.

You can either download the latest stable release version from: [Latest Release](https://github.com/AltaArts/OpenWithMenu--Prism-Plugin/releases/latest)

or download the current code zip file from the green "Code" button above or on [Github](https://github.com/JBreckeen/OpenWithMenu--Prism-Plugin/tree/main)

Copy the directory named "OpenWithMenu" to a directory of your choice, or a Prism2 plugin directory.

Prism's default plugin directories are: *{installation path}\Plugins\Apps* and *{installation Path}\Plugins\Custom*.

It is suggested to have all custom plugins in a seperate folder suchs as: *{drive}\ProgramData\Prism2\plugins\CustomPlugins*

You can add the additional plugin search paths in Prism2 settings.  Go to Settings->Plugins and click the gear icon.  This opens a dialogue and you may add additional search paths at the bottom.

Once added, you can either restart Prism2, or select the "Add existing plugin" (plus icon) and navigate to where you saved the OpenWithMenu folder.
